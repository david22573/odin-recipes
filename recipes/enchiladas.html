    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a type of pasta made of very wide, flat sheets. It is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.

        Originating in Italy during the Middle Ages and have traditionally been ascribed to the city of Naples. The first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.
